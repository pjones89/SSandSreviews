What I mean by that is, the first couple seasons are great, but slow, so a lot of viewers drop off before they get to the last 4 seasons, which are just so incredibly perfect. It is suspenseful, fun, romantic, and funny! Even though half the characters are already ones you met in Breaking Bad, the new characters are what make the show even better! From Nacho, to Kim, to Chuck, to even Lalo, they are all amazing characters and great additions to the Breaking Bad universe.",

The Kettleman case is just so much fun and allows us to see the relationship between Jimmy and HHM. The reveal towards the end of Chuck being the one who has always been against Jimmy was just so well done. It's the beginning of the end for their relationship as brothers, and you can really feel the pain Jimmy must be feeling. Kim quickly becomes a fan favorite character, as she is able to become more than just the 'main characters girlfriend'. She is an intriguing character and really helps fuel a lot of the decisions Jimmy makes.",

Jimmy's side of the story starts to get more interesting later in the season when he tries to save Kim's new client from being poached by HHM. This really makes the Chuck v Jimmy aspect so much more fun and interesting. As clever as Jimmy is, Chuck is just so smart and knows his brother so well. This is shown in the very last scene when it is revealed Chuck recorded Jimmy while he was confessing. Very awesome cliffhanger leaving the audience wanting more.",

Based on what we know from Breaking Bad, Hector has always been the reason behind everything that Gus does, so it makes sense that he would meet Mike because of it. As far as Jimmy's side goes, this is the culmination of the Chuck story. Jimmy finally beats Chuck in one of the best episodes of the show: Chicanery. The acting is so great, and it feels so good to see Chuck finally lose. Very sad ending to the season with Chuck killing himself, but it is a fitting ending and leads to some very interesting stuff in the next season",

Seeing him pretend to cry about Chuck when trying to get his law license back was very interesting, especially with how it even fools Kim. Showing her that he might be further gone than she thought. On the cartel side, we get to see the origin of the meth lab. Very cool seeing the Germans and how Gus and Mike had to keep them all secluded so nobody would know what they were doing. It's also great character development for Mike as it leads to him having to kill his friend, Werner Ziegler, for Gus. This is also the season we are introduced to Lalo, who is my favorite villain in the whole Breaking Bad universe! He is just so charismatic and so scary at the same time.",

When Lalo comes to Saul and Kim's place to intimidate them, it is so intense and so much fun. Leading to the last episode where the crap hits the fan for Lalo. His whole family is murdered, and he knows Nacho and Gus were the ones to orchestrate it.

The first half shows Kim and Jimmy slowly moving forward with their plans to ruin Howard's career and reputation. It doesn't reveal every part of the plan to the audience, which makes the episode, Plan and Execution, that much more exciting and fun! Everything goes perfectly in taking down Howard, until the end, where the cartel side of the show meets the lawyer side of the show. Lalo shows up and kills Howard and it is just so devastating. Then Gus beats Lalo and kills him! So crazy. Then we get into the last few episodes, where we see Kim leave her life she was living (including Jimmy) because of the events that happened with Lalo and Howard. Then We see much more of 'post-Breaking Bad Saul' as Gene, leading to him getting caught and having to decide whether he wants to use his Slippin Jimmy charm to get his sentence down as much as possible, or serve the time he deserves. Such a great ending for this show and it leaves you with such a satisfied feeling. Saul finally owns up to all of his actions and has to pay the consequences.",

The train heist was one of the most intense and fun sequences in the whole show! Ending with the sadistic Todd shooting the innocent child. Walt killing Mike for no reason at all, and then putting out a hit on all those guys in prison within the span of two minutes was the most evil you have ever seen him. Then you get into the part where Hank figures it all out, and the secret is out. Walt is Heisenberg! Hank v Walt is such an interesting showdown as it is brute force (Hank) against brains (Walt). Which is interesting that each of their last moves against each other is actually the opposite of their normal tendencies. Hank uses his brain to catch Walt, when he tricks him to revealing the location of the money. Then Walt's final move is using brute force, when he gets Todd's uncle and his group of violent nazis to come save him. Brilliant writing! The last few episodes are depressing, but perfect. Walt deserved to lose everything and Jesse deserved freedom, and in the end, that's exactly what they got. Incredible series.",

And again and again. This show is very well written, acted, and directed! The music is awesome and makes you feel like you are right in the action. Speaking of which, Elliot talking to you as his imaginary friend throughout the story actually does make you feel like you are part of the story! Probably the most underrated show in this list.",

Then the reveal that Mr. Robot is actually just a part of Elliot. By the end of this season, your whole view of the show completely changes! These twists makes this season very rewatchable, as you want to try to find certain scenes that foreshadow the twists.",

The ALF episode is super different and fun, and actually pretty dark when you realize why he is experiencing that. Then the next big twist of the show. The reveal that Elliot has been in jail the entire first half of this season, but he has been shielding you from seeing that. Such a creative twist! The buildup to seeing Tyrell again is awesome, and the finale is very intense. They do a great job at making you question whether Tyrell is real or just part of Elliot's imagination. Then you realize Tyrell is actually real when he shoots Elliot to prevent him from ruining the plan they have spent this whole time on. Very good subversion if expectations from the last seasons finale to this one",

I love the episode that is almost completely without words. It starts with Darlene saying 'It's okay dude. We don't have to talk' and then continues an action packed episode without a single word until the very ending where we hear Vera say 'It's time we talk'. So awesome! Vera's big episode is just as incredible! It is structured like a 5 act movie and it is so intense, funny, and crazy. Then we get the final reveal that the Elliot we have been following is not the real Elliot. He is just a separate personality that was created to 'save the world' from all the bad. It is so emotional when 'the mastermind' has to accept this and let the real Elliot take control back, which allows Darlene to finally talk to her brother that she has been wanting to talk to for so long. Heartbreaking and emotional. One of the most complete stories ever told, as it is clear the director knew how he wanted to end the show from the moment it began.",

She fills in the same role as Charles Miner from last season. A great actor who plays a character who is not funny and kind of takes away from the humor of the show. Overall a good season though, and the finale teases Holly coming back, which is exciting for Michael!",

Nobody really wants to care about two new characters (Clark and Pete), when this is the last season, and we are wanting to see all the characters we know and love for one last season! The only thing that makes this season okay, is the last four episodes. Very funny episodes, and I think they end the story perfectly! I don't think I have ever watched the last few episodes without crying. It's just such a great send off to all these characters we have gone through so much with!

Love the new characters of the season. Bob, Max, and Billy are all great characters and add new things for our main characters to deal with. Bobs death is so sad and so intense. I don't love that Eleven is separated from the group for most of the season, and I'm not a big fan of her episode with the 'freaks' in New York. When she does come back to the group, it is great! The snowball dance is so iconic and ends with a great cliffhanger. The mind flayer towers over the school in the upside down while you hear 'Every Breath You Take' in the background. Beautiful.",

Eleven losing her powers is an interesting plot point, especially because it forces the kids to get creative to defeat the monster of this season. Fireworks!",

We still get some fun scenes, especially in the beginning, but for the most part, it's such a dark season. I love it! The ending of the first episode with Chrissy getting brutally killed was SHOCKING. It serves as a great introduction to the two new characters of the season. Vecna and Eddie. It shows the scariness of Vecna and the innocence of Eddie. The reveal of 001 being the one who massacred all those kids at the beginning of the season was awesome. Then to top it all off, he is also Vecna! It makes the final battle between him and Eleven so much more personal, and it is great! Also, Hopper taking down a demagorgan with a sword is everything I have ever wanted to see. Eddie's rock concert to draw the bats away was so freaking amazing. Max's episode is iconic and so emotionally satisfying. Then at the end, when she gets some limbs broken and turns blind, but barely survives. Brutal and emotional. Really makes you want Vecna to get defeated in the last season. I guess we will see!",

Love the storyline of Desmond having flashes of the future with how Charlie is going to die. It sets up the best finale in the entire show. Charlie saving everybody by going down to where he knows he will drown is just so heroic! Especially since he gets one last message out to Desmond before he dies, 'Not Pennys Boat'. So good! But we aren't done yet. Then we get the reveal that the flashback of Jack spiraling out of control back at home is actually not a flashback, it is a flash forward! Revealing that at least he and Kate make it off the island! 'WE HAVE TO GO BACK!!' Such an amazing ending.",

I love that when she finally gets the bomb to explode, the screen turns white with the 'LOST' letters showing up. A contrast to all the previous episodes of the show ending with a black screen and the word 'LOST'. This, to me, signifies the end of the show is near, and it gives kind of a heavenly vibe, rather than the dark vibe of all the other season finales.",

It still has some great and emotional moments, but for the most part, I think the 'flash sideways' sequences don't work because it feels unimportant and inconsequential. Contrary to what most people think, I actually do like the story of Jacob and his brother. It continues the theme of dark versus light, so that's why I think it works. I absolutely LOVE the choice to make Hurley the long term protector of the island. I didn't think they would ever do that, because Hurley has always felt like a fun side character. So it was great to see him be the man like that! Most people think the ending is 'it was all a dream', but Jacks dad makes it clear when he says that everything that happened, actually happened. They all were just waiting in purgatory for everyone to die and meet there so they can move into the afterlife together. Pretty cheesy, but I think it works. This whole show has always been about love, and that's exactly how it ended.",

The psychiatrist is a great character that helps us see more into the mind of Ted Lasso. Rebecca and Sam's relationship is weird but actually very sweet and endearing. There isn't really a villain this season, except for the twist villain that doesn't get revealed until the final couple of episodes. Nate the (not-so) great! His betrayal of Ted and then his rant towards Ted at the end is just a huge gut punch, as we are left wondering (just like Ted) where the heck that came from. Upon rewatch of the season, there are a ton of hints to Nate slowly becoming the villain that I didn't catch the first time. That is great story telling right there.",

I love that, by the end, our main character has to figure out how to beat Kingpin both as Matt Murdock, the lawyer AND as Daredevil, the vigilante.

Then, the build up towards the finale is so incredible showing the downfall of Dex, turning him into full Bullseye. The prison fight scene with Daredevil trying to escape is so intense. I love it so much. Then the ending! Daredevil vs Kingpin vs Bullseye. What an amazing scene.
